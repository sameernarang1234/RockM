This is a hybrid (Both Android and IOS) mobile application to keep a record of the weekly work assigned to the student by his / her professor. The student has
to input the date on which the task was assigned, the deadline of the task and the description of the task. The app uses Google Firebase to store the details
of the task at the backend. I personally used this app during my MTech at Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee.
